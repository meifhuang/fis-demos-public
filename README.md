# Demo Applications

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Local Database (Supabase)

> **Requires Docker Engine**

```bash
npm run db:start
```

On success, this will output your local Supabase URL and Supabase Secret Key.

### 3. Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values.

At minimum:

- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`

Optionally:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required for generating new content)

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) is a Postgres-based backend as a service. The backend for this project is in the [fis-demos-backend project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xinjcpftgvjwpiunyixq).

While the `./supabase` directory in this repo could be elsewhere (e.g. it's own repo), we've opted to keep it together until we have a case for moving it.

Common commands:

```bash
npm run db:start      # starts Supabase locally (Docker required)
npm run db:status     # shows status and connection info
npm run db:reset      # resets DB, runs migrations, syncs types
npm run db:types      # generates src/types/database.ts
```

### Migrations

Generate migrations using the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started):

```bash
npx supabase migration new [name_of_migration]
```

Open the file generated and write the migration, considering best practices for data (constraints, indexes, unique indexes, timestamps, etc). When your migration is ready, lint and format it with `npm run lint:sql`, then perform the migration locally:

```bash
npx supabase migration up
```

When merged to `main`, the migration will run automatically in the Supabase production environment.

NOTE: the `./supabase/schema` is generated by `npm run db:dump` as a snapshot and kept for reference only. This enables us to see the result of a schema change in a version-controlled diff, as oppossed to understanding changes through the aggregate of individual migrations. Supabase does provide the option of [declarative schemas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/declarative-database-schemas), but the overhead of managing their order is a bit much right now.

### DB lint & test

The Supabase CLI includes [tools to test and lint the DB](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/testing-and-linting). After experimenting with basic DB tests, we dropped them in favor of application tests that integrate with the DB: writing tests in SQL is not a very developer friendly experience, and the value the tests provide isn't clear (i.e. it matters more how our app interacts with the DB).

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Docker Engine ([Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) is the easiest way to install Docker Engine)

#### Recommended

Configure your text editor with the following linters:

- [ActionLint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) NOTE: this is not included as a direct dependency of the project. You can install it with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/actionlint).
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [SQLFluff](https://www.sqlfluff.com/) NOTE: this is not included as a direct dependency of the project. You can install it with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/sqlfluff).

### Pre-commit

We use [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged) to run checks on changed files before committing.
